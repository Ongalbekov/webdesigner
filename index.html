          <p>
            Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
            could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted
            to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on
            paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some
            challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I
            saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user
            interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the
            result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.

                <p>
                  You will start seeing things differently and coming up with
                  more effective ways of achieving goals.

                <p>
                  By looking at problems from a different perspective, your
                  ideas will be fresher and more valuable.

                  Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand
                  the frustration of the users and resolve to end it.

                <h4>Share and show your work</h4>
                <p>
                  As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not
                  finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept
                  feedback and learn from it.
